REDO LISTS as SESSIONS

class db
id
users
sessions
name


IDEA
send all students in session an object with position number and revision number
Removes complex position needs

no general update on addition, and with revision number TAs maybe can have in right order?
on removal from head, can be easy for TAs as just remove head(also can just send full list every time)
    Simply send new position to everyone

Move all errors to responses and simplify?



Important:-0p=
longterm convert string array to string set for classes user
only show errors if process.env.say stage is dev else display generic error and let client display warning
add check to create class for duplicate class names?
color class names by id on website so that all classes get unique but constant color 

clean up code
clean up user interface
